## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [SnipSnap](https://github.com/TrackerJo/SnipSnap) - AI Accountability Partner

**Problem:** Digital task managers lack the satisfaction of completion—checking a box doesn't feel rewarding. People are returning to paper lists because digital tools feel hollow and unsatisfying.

**Solution:** Gamified task completion app that requires photo proof of finished work, verified by AI. Rewards users with satisfying animations, tracks streaks, and turns productivity into an engaging challenge rather than a chore.

**My contributions (2-person team):** AI integration (Gemini Vision API), state management with custom React hooks, Firebase architecture and authentication

**Tech:** React 19 • Firebase • Gemini Vision API • Vite  
**Impact:** 🏆 1st place in Humanities Track at Anthropic Build-a-Thon

*Note: Built via pair programming—commits appear under teammate's account*

### [ParTee](https://github.com/AnoushkaChakravarty/CS180GroupProject) - Golf Reservation System

**Problem:** Traditional golf course reservation systems can't safely handle multiple concurrent bookings, leading to double-bookings and data conflicts during peak hours.

**Solution:** Thread-safe client-server reservation platform using read/write locking and persistent storage. Handles 100+ simultaneous clients while maintaining data integrity—built as CS180 final project.

**My contributions (5-person team):** 
- **Product:** Conceptualized key features and user flows for reservation management
- **Architecture:** Designed and implemented thread-safe database with Singleton pattern and read/write locks
- **Development:** Worked on database layer, CRUD operations, and client-server communication logic
- **Testing:** Wrote unit tests for concurrency, persistence, and edge cases

**Tech:** Java • TCP Sockets • JUnit • Maven  
**Scale:** 150+ unit tests, <50ms avg response time, zero deadlocks across 1000+ test scenarios
